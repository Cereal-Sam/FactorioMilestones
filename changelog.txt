Version: 1.3.0
Date: ????

  Features:
    - Add milestone groups. You can categorize milestones, and either view them sorted by group, or sorted chronologically.
      Existing games won't automatically change. To add groups to your loaded milestones, please reload your preset in the settings.
    - Add "Exact time" option for editing estimation ranges. This can be useful if you've lost your times but have a screenshot of your previous milestones.
    - Add preset for 248k Mod (Thanks to PreLeyZero!)

  Changes:
    - Milestones settings can now only be changed by admins, instead of relying on "Mod Settings Changed" permissions. This seems to match with Factorio's own conditions on modifying Mod Settings.
    - Changing the settings in a multiplayer game will now indicate who did the change in the chat message.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fix crash when the GUI was cleared through another mod or command.

Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2022-02-20

  Bugfixes:
    - Fix infinite milestone not creating next step when backfilling a milestone with an estimation range.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2022-02-20

  Features:
    - Infinite Milestones: 
      You can now set a "next" value for a milestone. When that milestone is completed, a new milestone is automatically created at a higher count, depending on that "next" value. 
      Example: "1000 science packs, next: x10" would create "10000 science packs" when completed, then "100000 science packs", etc. You can also use "+" for adding instead of multiplying.
    - You can now export or import encoded milestone sets (for a shorter, but non-human-readable string).
    - New "Compact list" Player Mod Setting, removes the "Completed at:" labels from the main view. Defaults to off.

  Changes:
    - Change presets to use infinite milestones. Existing sets won't be updated unless you reload them from the preset.
    - Labels now say "Killed at" and "Researched at" for kills and technologies
    - Replace "cargo rocket section" with "cargo rocket" in SE and SE+K2 presets
